* Spacemacs Rocks Season 2 (day-14)

Topic: File and buffer operations

** Talk the difference between the configs of mine and spacemacs

** File related operations
   - SPC-p-f (find a file in current project, it looks like the Ctrl-p plugins in Vim), do some hack to enhance the SPC-p-f
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (defun vincent/open-file-with-projectile-or-counsel-git ()
         (interactive)
         (if (vincent/vcs-project-root)
             (counsel-git)
           (if (projectile-project-p)
               (projectile-find-file)
             (ido-find-file))))
     #+END_SRC
     + If it's a git repository, I use `counsel-git' to find file.
     + Why not `projectile', Because I think ivy-mode is much faster. If it is in a project. say it has `.projectile' file in your project's root. Otherwise, you `ido-find-file'
   - =SPC-f-f=:     to find a file start from the current directory
   - =SPC-f-L=:     find the file across the whole Mac system
   - =SPC-f-l=:     find file literally(I also enhance this func with ffap)
   - =SPC-f-h=:     find file in hex mode(I also enhance this func with ffap)
   - =SPC-f-o=:     open with external program
   - =SPC-f-E=:     sudo edit
   - =SPC-f-D=:     delete current file and buffer
   - =SPC-f-j=:     open the current file's dired mode
   - =SPC-f-r=:     find the recents file with ivy
   - =SPC-f-R=:     Rename the current file
   - =SPC-f-v=:     add local variables
   - =SPC-f-y-y=:   yank current buffer's full path 
   - =SPC-f-a-d=:   find the current visited directory with fast.
   - =SPC-f-C-d/u=: covert file encoding between unix and dos
   - =SPC-f-e-d=:   find the ~/.spacemacs or ~/.spacemacs.d/init.el file
   - =SPC-f-e-i=:   find the ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el init file
   - =SPC-f-e-l=:   helm locate library file
   - =SPC-f-c=:     copy file
   - =SPC-f-b=:     show bookmarks
   - =SPC-f-s/S=:   save buffers
     
** Buffer related operations
   - =SPC-b-.=: buffer micro state(hydra)
   - =SPC-b-b=: switch buffers, i rebind it to ivy-switch-buffer, because I could see recent use file in buffer
   - =SPC-b-d=: kill a buffer
   - =SPC-b-B=: global list buffers
   - =SPC-b-h=: go to home
   - =SPC-b-k=: kill matching buffers
   - =SPC-b-N=: new empty buffer
   - =SPC-b-n=: Next buffer
   - =SPC-b-p=: Previous buffer
   - =SPC-b-r=: helm-recentf
   - =SPC-b-R=: safe revert buffer
   - =SPC-b-m=: Messages buffer
   - =SPC-b-s=: Scratch buffer
   - =SPC-b-w=: toggle buffer read-only
   - =SPC-b-Y=: copy the whole buffer to clipboard, the content could be used in other programs
   - =SPC-b-P=: paste to the whole buffer
   - =SPC-<tab>=: switch between the current buffer and the last opened buffer.

** Sometimes I also use the `dired' mode to do all the files operations
   - back to previous section

** Happy hacking!
