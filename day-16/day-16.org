Topic: ctags and company mode for auto completion

** Why use ctags for auto completion
1. Some dynamic languages don't support syntax-aware auto completion, For example
   - Javascript (though tern-mode could do some sort of auto completion, but the configuration is complex and it's not always reliable)
   - Lua use ctags for C/C++, use Emacs writing and navigating C/C++ code, but use IDE to debug and profiling.
2. ctags is very fast and reliable

** How to configure ctags and auto completion?
1. ctags -eR . company-etags (company-etags can't used for every major-mode)

** How to use ctags effectively?
   1. project wide configurations for auto generating the tags file
   2. configure the ctags rules for generate more tags
   3. use etags-select to quickly navigate a large code base

** Final thoughts

- when syntax-aware auto completion is not available, consider to use ctags instead.
