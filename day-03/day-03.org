* Spacemacs Rocks Episode 2(Day Three)

** Split your configurations into multiple files.
1. Use Git to management your init file
2. help window is annoying
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'popwin)
  (popwin-mode t)
#+END_SRC
3. load-file, load-path and load
4. features, provide and require, autoload
5. naming convention
   * all of the names should have a prefix
   * such that the naming conflicts could be minimal.
6. define your abbrevs
7. how to organize your configs
- init-packages.el
- init-ui.el
- init-better-defaults.el
- init-keybindings.el
- custom.el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
#+END_SRC 
8. user `counsel-git` to find file in git managed project.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p f") 'counsel-git)
#+END_SRC

** Major mode and minor mode in details

** Better defaults

** Dired mode and file related operations

** Bonous time: Use org-mode literate programming to organize you Emacs configurations.

** Exercise
1. define C-x C-e in js2-mode to eval js expression after nodejs-repl mode is actived.
2. Only turn on linum-mode when doing programming (tips: use prog-mode-hook)
