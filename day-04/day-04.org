* Spacemacs Rocks Season 2 (Day 4)

** Talk more about load, load-file, require, provide and auto-load
   - load
   - load-filf
   - require
   - provide
   - autoload

** Better defaults
   - indent-region or buffer
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun indent-buffer ()
    "Indent the current visited buffer"
    (interactive)
    (indent-region (point-min) (point-max)))

  (defun indent-region-or-buffer ()
    "Indent a region if selected, otherwise the whole buffer."
    (interactive)
    ;; save last cursor position
    (save-excursion
      (if            (region-active-p)
	  (progn
	    (indent-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
				(message "Indented selected region."))
	(progn
	  (indent-buffer)
	  (message "Indented buffer.")))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-\\") 'indent-region-or-buffer)

   #+END_SRC
   - another way to complete thingr in Emacs
     1. complete function and system path
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-/") 'hippie-expand)
  ;; hippie expand is dabbrev expand on steroids
  (setq hippie-expand-try-functions-list '(try-expand-dabbrev
					   try-expand-dabbrev-all-buffers
					   try-expand-dabbrev-from-kill
					   try-complete-file-name-partially
					   try-complete-file-name
					   try-expand-all-abbrevs
					   try-expand-list
					   try-expand-line
					   try-complete-lisp-symbol-partially
					   try-complete-lisp-symbol))

   #+END_SRC

** Dired mode and file related operations
   - Manage your local files
   - dired-mode: C-x-d
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; dired - reuse current buffer by pressing 'a'
     (put 'dired-find-alternate-file 'disabled nil)

     ;; always delete and copy recursively
     (setq dired-recursive-deletes 'always)
     (setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)

     ;; If non-nil, Dired tries to guess a default target directory.
     ;; This means: if there is a Dired buffer displayed in the next
     ;; window, use its current directory, instead of this Dired buffer’s
     ;; current directory.(Dirctly operations one file to another window)

     ;; delay load
     (eval-after-load "dired"
       '(progn
	  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'dired-find-alternate-file)))

     ;; less typing when Emacs ask you yes or no
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

   #+END_SRC
   - Create new file and folder
     1) +: create a new folder
     2) C-x C-f: create a new time
     3) g: refresh dired buffer
     4) C: Copy fiue
     5) D: Delete file
     6) s: Sort file
     7) R: Rename file
   - Open dired on current buffer
     1) allow you to jump to current directory with dired mode
     2) C-x C-j
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'dired-x)

   #+END_SRC
   - open finder on MacOSX (You only need a Mac Computer)
     1) Package: reveal-in-osx-finder
     2) M-x package-install RET revveal-in-osx-fender
     3) Open current file path of current file.
     4) Usage: M-x reveai-in-osx-finder

** Bonus Time. Use Org-mode literate programing to organize your Emacs's configurations
- Create a file named "vincent.org" in "~/.emacs.d/", it will be replace your original init.el role
- Paste the follow code to your init file(only this few code)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-install)
  (require 'ob-tangle)
  (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "vincent.org" user-emacs-directory))
#+END_SRC
- just like this
  + vincent.org
#+BEGIN_SRC organize
* Emacs文学编程

** 初始化所有的Package
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)

#+END_SRC

** 配置LoadPath
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")

  (require 'init-func)
  (require 'init-packages)
  (require 'init-ui)
  (require 'init-better-defaults)
  (require 'init-org)
  (require 'init-keybindings)

  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "lisp/custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load-file custom-file)

#+END_SRC
  + init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  ;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
  ;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
  ;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
  ;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
  ;;
  ;; Customize settings.

  (require 'org-install)
  (require 'ob-tangle)
  (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "vincent.org" user-emacs-directory))

#+END_SRC
